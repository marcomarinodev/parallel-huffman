### TODO
- [X] write `seq_write_file_string` to write human readable compressed file
- [X] write `seq_compress`
- [X] use `seq_write_file_string` and `seq_compress` to generate a true result in order to test `par_compress`
- [X] create different compositions and make some measurements
- [ ] implement the `fastflow` version
  - [ ] make tests
